            <p>
                translations let you move an element around on the page with just css.
                for IE9, Android up to 4.4.3, iOS8, and Blackberry 10. Use the folowing to make it work.
                "-webkit-transform: translate(45px,-45px); /* iOS8, Android 4.4.3, BB10 */
                -ms-transform: translate(45px,-45px); /* IE9 only */
                transform: translate(45px,-45px);"
                transform: translate(x, y) or use translateX() and translateY() for just one direction.
                <strong>You must display block for this to work.</strong>
                transform: scale(x, y) or one value will be applied to both x and why enter the ecimal that you want it to grow or shrink by.
                scaleX() and scaleY() for jut enlarging one dimention.
                Don't use multiple transforms because they orverride eachother just add the arjuments on the same transform.
                Rotate() ues degrees.
                skew(x, y) only x is skewed if one paramiter is provided.
                Use transform-origin to change what the element is transforing around.
                The order matters because if you move an element with translate fter rotating it it will move at the angle ou rotated it to.
                </p>
                <h4>---IE 8---</h4>
                <p>
                you can use position relitive with the top and left valuses to move elements in IE8.
                ".translate {
                    position: relative;
                    top: 200px;
                    left: 200px;
                }"
                width and height or justy font-size can work like scale().
                To rotate it is more dificult and does has bad prformance.
                ".rotate {
                    transform: rotate(15deg);  
                    filter: progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.Matrix(
                        sizingMethod='auto expand', M11=0.9659258262890683, 
                        M12=-0.25881904510252074, M21=0.25881904510252074, 
                        M22=0.9659258262890683); 
                    -ms-filter: "progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.Matrix(
                        M11=0.9659258262890683, M12=-0.25881904510252074, 
                        M21=0.25881904510252074, M22=0.9659258262890683,
                        sizingMethod='auto expand')"; 
                    zoom: 1;
                }"

            </p>
            <h4>Animation</h4>
            <p>
                While using Java script can do this in IE9 it is resource intensive and all oher browses suort doing it in css so it is bes to do it there.
                To make an animation.
                1 set the initial stle for the element.
                2 declare the final state of the element.
                3 include transition proporties (transition-property, transition-duration, transition-timing-function, and transition-delay.)
                -webkit- is neede in older browsers.
                transition-timing-function tels if you want it to change all at onece or tatr quick or slow and then even out the rest of he transition.
                transition-delay is for a delay befor the transition starts.
                A negative value makes it imeadiatly triger part way theough than go back to the begining and transition to the mid point.
                transition: transform 0.2s ease-out 50ms;
                As short hand for each function. If a delay is included, you must also include a duration, and the duration must precede the delay, Other proporties don't matter with order.
                to use multiple propories at the same 
                transition: transform 0.2s ease-out 50ms, color 0.1s linear 50ms; or
                transition: transform color 0.2s ease-out 50ms;
                You can use all insted of multiple proporties, but be aware hat there might be unexpected things tha hapen with all.
                This is the les controled way than using Animation which is nex.
            </p>
            <h4>Animating with animation</h4>
            <p>
                Use -webkit on older browsers like transitions.
                basicly you use keyframes and the animation happens between the points.
                @keyframes to define a keyframe.
                example of old
                @-webkit-keyframes myAnimation { 
                    /* put animation keyframes here */
                }
                example of newr browsers
                @keyframes myAnimation { 
                    /* put animation keyframes here */
                }
                they are organized by a persentage of the animation from 0 to 100.
                to aplly an animation.
                animation-name: appearDisappear;
                animation-duration: 300ms;
                to adjust how i runs.
                transition-timing-function: ease, linear, ease-in, ease-out, ease-in-out.
                Steps alow for controling how the animation moves.
                To diffine what an animation looks like when it is not playing ues
                animation-fill-mode: backwards for the first frame, forwards for the last, none for the last, and both dose the first.
                animation-play-state for running or paused.
                verbose and shorthand
                .verbose {
                    animation-name: appearDisappear; 
                    animation-duration: 300ms; 
                    animation-timing-function: ease-in;
                    animation-iteration-count: 1;
                    animation-direction: alternate;
                    animation-delay: 5s;
                    animation-fill-mode: backwards;
                    animation-play-state: running;
                }
                
                /* shorthand */
                .concise {
                    animation: 300ms ease-in alternate 5s backwards appearDisappear;
                }
                Beware of naming an animation any value for an animation!


            </p>
            <strong>Do not use animations when you don't need to it get distracting and bogs down a page!</strong>
            <h3>Chapter 12</h3>
            <p>
                to use canvas api you will need a canvas element.
                "&#60;canvas&#62;
                    Sorry! Your browser doesnâ€™t support Canvas.
                    &#60;/canvas&#62;"
            </p>
            <h4>SVG</h4>
            <p>
                <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 400 400">
                    <circle cx="50" cy="50" r="25" fill="red"/>
                </svg>
                you can add a description (desc tag)
                <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 400 400">

                </svg>
                filter is an option to add effects


            </p>
            <h4>API</h4>
            <p>
                APIs work a bit differntly in JavaScript than in java.
                Because they are a bit like a class that gives extra functionality to JS like the drag and drop.
                However, at lest with that API you have to override a lot of default functions so check that when you are using them.
