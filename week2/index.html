    <h1>Week 2 Notes</h1> 
    <h2>Callbacks</h2>
    <p>A lot of this week was review, however learning about callbacks was new to me. 
        I supose that they might be present in other languages I have learned but the functionality that they have in Java Script is very cool. 
        The syntax is simple put a refence to the calback function in the paramiters of the function you are creating. 
        in the function code you will have to use the palceholder name folowed bu parenthisis to call your callback function. 
        When calling the new function place the name of the function it will calback in the paramiters without parethises.
        A good practise is to use a comparator to check that a function has been passed before you use it. (type(functionName) === function)
    </p>

    <h2>Lambda</h2>
    <p>While it is not called the the same thing in Java Script the arrow functions works prety much the same as a lambda.
        declaring has a few diferent methods.
        const functionName = paramiterName => a single line declaratin here is aoutmaticaly returned;
        If there is no paramiter how empty () instead for multiple use (a, b).
        if it is a multi line function ad {}; but still have the semicolon at the end.
    </p>
    <h3>question</h3>
    <p>I have a question about how these work with callbacks because the syntax seemed to not actually call the functions.</p>

    <h2>Other chapters</h2>
    <p>As I have already learned a few programing languages so the other chapters were just review about the foundational programing consepts of:
        data types,
        compartors,
        objects,
        logic,
        loops,
        keywords.
    </p>
    <script>
        //if I have time before turing this in I am going to try to add a few arrow functions here and learn how that works.
