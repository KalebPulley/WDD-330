    <h1>Week 5 Notes</h1>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <h3>Strict Mode</h3>
    <p>Stric mode helps check for bad coding practices or out of date features.
        put 'use strict'; on the first line to use it.
        other wise you are using sloppy mode:)
    </p>
    <h3>Error handeling</h3>
    <p>TDD is making code to testy your code first than building the code.</p>
    <p>
    1 Write tests (that initially fail)

    2 Write code to pass the tests
        
    3 Refactor the code
        
    4 Test refactored code
        
    5 Write more tests for new features</p>
    <h3>Jest</h3>
    <p>npm install -g jest
        To install the tool.
    </p>
    <p>jets works by running the checks in files that have .test as part of the file extention. like "main.test.js".
        It checks test() functions. syntax is test('comments describeing what you are testing.', () =>{function to test hear}

    </p>
    <p>to run the test 
        jest -c {}
        in the folder wih the files to test.
    </p>
    <p>normal pactice is to have a seperat file with the tests.</p>
    <h3>remember to remove debuging before publishing code.</h3>
